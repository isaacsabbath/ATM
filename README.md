## Overview
This is a simple C++ banking application designed to help me gain a better understanding of core programming concepts. Users can:
* Enter a PIN for security
* Check their account balance
* Deposit funds
* Withdraw funds
* Transfer money
* Exit the application
## Learning Objectives
This application has been instrumental in helping me:
* Understand the use of variables to store account information.
* Implement loops for repeated user input and menu navigation.
* Develop functions to organize code into reusable blocks, enhancing readability and maintainability.
## Future Developments
I plan to enhance the application with the following features:
* Multiple User Accounts: Allow different users to create accounts with unique authentication.
* Array Implementation: Utilize arrays to manage multiple user accounts and their balances.
* Inter-User Money Transfers: Enable users to wire money to one another, enhancing the application's functionality.
